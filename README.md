# A* Pathfinding Visualizer (Elite Edition) 🚀

An advanced, interactive pathfinding tool built with **Python** and **Pygame**. This version implements the A* algorithm with 8-directional movement and terrain-based cost analysis.

## 🌟 Key Upgrades
* [cite_start]**8-Directional Movement**: Uses Chebyshev distance to allow for realistic diagonal paths[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Weighted Terrain (Mud)**: Introduces cost-based pathfinding where specific nodes are more "expensive" to cross[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Dynamic HUD**: Real-time tracking of nodes explored during the search process[cite: 12, 13].
* [cite_start]**Priority Queue Optimization**: Uses a Priority Queue to ensure the most efficient node is always processed next[cite: 8, 10].

## 🎮 Controls
* [cite_start]**Left Click**: Set Start (Orange), End (Turquoise), and Barriers (Black)[cite: 18, 19].
* **W + Left Click**: Paint Mud/Weighted Terrain (Brown).
* [cite_start]**Right Click**: Reset any node[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Space**: Run the A* algorithm[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**C**: Clear the entire grid[cite: 23].
